# zombieSimJC

This is a simple simulation of a zombie simulation.

The main method asks for different parameters such as the initial number of susceptibles and the size of the island.
Once configured the simulation will run with different colored text marking different events.
After the simulation has ended you will run with two graphs: A static graph that shows the populations of different objects growing/shrinking
And also a simulation graph that shows where each object is moving at on an x/y plane.
